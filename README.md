# Employee Management System (Python OOP Demo)

This is a simple Python project demonstrating the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**. The system models a basic organizational structure with `Employee`, `Developer`, and `Manager` classes.

## Features

- Create and manage `Employee`, `Developer`, and `Manager` objects.
- Apply raise amounts differently based on employee type.
- Manage lists of employees under a manager.
- Demonstrates Python features such as:
  - Inheritance via `Developer` and `Manager` classes.
  - Use of `super()` to call base class constructors.
  - Built-in functions like `isinstance()` and `issubclass()` for class relationships.

## Code Overview

### Classes:

- **Employee**
  - Attributes: `first`, `last`, `pay`, `email`
  - Methods: `full_name()`, `apply_raise()`

- **Developer (inherits from Employee)**
  - Additional Attribute: `programming_language`
  - Overridden `raise_amount`

- **Manager (inherits from Employee)**
  - Additional Attribute: `employees` (list)
  - Methods: `add_employee()`, `remove_employee()`, `print_employees()`

### Example Usage:

```python
dev_1 = Developer('Corey', 'Schafer', 50000, 'Python')
dev_2 = Developer('Test', 'Employee', 60000, 'Java')

mgr_1 = Manager('Sue', 'Smith', 90000, [dev_1])
mgr_1.add_employee(dev_2)
mgr_1.remove_employee(dev_1)
mgr_1.print_employees()
````

### Output:

```
sue.smith@company.com
--> Test Employee
True
True
False
True
True
False
```
